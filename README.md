# GTA5-Backlight-Mod
GTA5 mod that interract with Adalight leds

To compile the .asi plugin, you need to:
-  download the ScriptHookV SDK from https://www.dev-c.com/gtav/scripthookv/
- extract inc & lib folder in the root folder where you put the GTA5-Backlight-Mod folder

And That's all...

Curently, this will only work with Adalight, and you need to change the leds number and effects inside the source code (it will be changed later)
